The point of this project is to give NFL information, and to compare QB stats from the 2023 season. 
The project is an NFL Dashbord with 3 tabs:
1) Page 1 shows the NFL teams and what it
2) This page allows you to pick 2 QB's and then compare their passing yards rate
3) This allows you to pick just one QB and then see how they did in the 2023 season


1) Do not run process-data.py since that will output a different CSV file, I have many CSV files so it will also take some time to run.
2) Just run app.py
3) Data has: the QB stats which was imported through a .csv file from the interent which was an excel file first and then converted to a csv file. I had to drop columns manually throughe excel, and then I add the .csv to data. 


In order to run the app just download the code and run app.py. 
You can create a virtual enviornment, and uv pip install all the needed libraries.
Don't run anything else since it will modify everything and may break there are many csv files, and in order to get some of the data I had to manually enter data so running the data could lose some of it. There are over 50 files to run and that will take awhile.
